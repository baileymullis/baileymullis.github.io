      <p>Members of the Roy family prepare to celebrate the 80th birthday of Logan Roy, CEO of the family-owned media conglomerate Waystar RoyCo. 
      Logan's second-oldest son Kendall believes he is the company heir following his father's retirement, but Logan shocks his family at his 
      birthday celebration by announcing that he will not be stepping down as CEO. He presents his children with papers giving his third wife, 
      Marcia, two votes on the trust to decide his successor upon his death. During the family's traditional softball game, Logan fires his longtime 
      COO Frank Vernon, and agrees to give a new position to his estranged great-nephew Greg Hirsch, who was fired from his job at one of Waystar's 
      parks. Kendall leaves the game to secure Waystar's acquisition of the media startup Vaulter. On the helicopter ride back to New York City, 
      Logan and his children Roman, Shiv, and Connor argue over the terms of the agreement, but Logan suddenly collapses from a hemorrhagic stroke 
      and is rushed to the hospital. Kendall receives word of Logan's stroke from Lawrence Yee, Vaulter's CEO and Kendall's rival, immediately 
      after securing the acquisition deal, and rushes to the hospital. </p>

      </div>
      <p>The Roy children are in disagreement over who should take control of Waystar in the wake of Logan's incapacitation: Roman and Connor 
      want to sign the papers out of respect for their father's wishes, whereas Kendall believes he should become CEO, and Shiv is opposed 
      based on doubts about Marcia's role in the company. Marcia sends Greg to retrieve Logan's items from his apartment. Roman asks Greg to 
      bring the trust change papers, but Shiv instructs the opposite; Greg ultimately decides not to bring the papers. Shiv's boyfriend Tom 
      Wambsgans proposes to her at the hospital, and she accepts. It is eventually agreed that Kendall should become acting CEO of Waystar with 
      Roman as COO. Waystar's general counsel, Gerri Kellman, informs Kendall that Logan is $3 billion in debt due to his expansion into parks. 
      Logan wakes up in his hospital bed. </p>

      </div>
      <p>Kendall learns that one of the creditors to Waystar's family holding company is entitled to demand full repayment for Logan's $3 billion
      debt if Waystar's stock falls below $130 per share. After a failed attempt to negotiate with the bank, Kendall enlists the aid of Stewy 
      Hosseini, his friend from college who is now a private-equity investor. Stewy agrees to inject $4 billion into Waystar in return for stock 
      and a seat on the company's board. However, Greg later spots Stewy meeting with Sandy Furness, Logan's enemy who wants to take control of Waystar.
      Kendall is also trying to repair his marriage with his estranged wife Rava, but after a night together, she confirms she has already hired a 
      divorce lawyer. Shiv asks Nate Sofrelli, a fellow political fixer and former boyfriend, to run a background check on Marcia. Kendall visits a 
      recovering Logan to inform him that Waystar's stock has still fallen below $130, but that his efforts have staved off a greater financial decline. 
      Logan nonetheless disapproves. </p>
